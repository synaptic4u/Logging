/**
 * Class LogFile
 *
 * Handles logging messages to a specified file. The log entry includes a timestamp,
 * user ID, and the message content. If the message is an array, it is formatted
 * as a JSON string. The log file is stored in a 'logs' directory relative to the
 * project's root.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - __construct($msg, $file, $userid): Initializes the log message, file, and user ID, then writes the log entry.
 * - writeLog(): Opens the log file in append mode, writes the constructed log message, and then closes the file.
 * - buildPath(): Constructs the file path for the log file by navigating three directories up from the current file's location and appending the 'logs' directory and the file name with a '.txt' extension.
 * - buildMessage(): Builds a formatted log message string that includes the current timestamp, user ID, and the log message. If the log message is an array, it is iterated over and each key-value pair is appended to the message. Nested arrays are JSON encoded for readability.
